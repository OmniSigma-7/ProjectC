Made it to step 3-4
The code is supposed to properly read a file and its contents
the buffer size is set to 1024 
Supposed to contain a terminate function that is in a loop as of right now
execute program function is supposed to load a progam into memory then it would call the launchprogram to start the execution 
interrupt21h  is set as an interruption function 
Not entirely sure on how to test the code itself as I have to admit I did rush at the end
